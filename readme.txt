Instant WooCommerce order integration with Miracle Fulfillment - A warehousing and shipping company that specializes helping web-based businesses.

== Description ==

= Let Us Do The Work =

You have a business to run. You shouldn't be spending time packing boxes or licking stamps. Let us do that for you.

[Miracle Fulfillment](http://www.miraclefulfillment.com "Miracle Fulfillment Home Page") is a warehousing and order fulfillment company designed from the ground up to work with small-to-medium sized web-based merchants.

This plugin will let you effortlessly integrate your WooCommerce shopping cart with our warehouse systems. When your orders hit the "Processing" status, they will be automatically transmitted to our warehouse systems. Orders received by 11:00am will almost always ship the same day. We guarantee shipping within 2 business days no matter what, but it's rare that it ever takes more than 1. 

After we've shipped your order, our system will communicate the tracking number back to your shopping cart and set the status to "Complete". If you happen to use the "WooCommerce Shipment Tracking" plugin, we'll update it there. Otherwise, a comment will be automatically created on the order with the tracking number.


= Save Money On Every Package =

To save you every possible penny, each individual package is rate shopped at all carriers and the least expensive shipping option that meets your required service level is automatically selected. You never have to worry about which service is going to give you the best deal because we find out on a package by package basis for every order we ship!


= Free Postal Address Verification =

Every package we ship undergoes address verification at no cost to you. This prevents postal returns and saves you money and saves your customer frustration!


= 100% Accuracy Guarantee =

We don't make many mistakes, but we're human. The good news is we stand behind our service. If we mispick an order, we'll credit you for the shipping cost and reship the order at our expense. If our error causes you to lose inventory and your customer won't ship it back on our dime, we'll also credit you your cost for the lost product.


= We Pay Your Cost To Switch! =

Are you already using another warehouse? It can be expensive to transfer all that stock. We will pay the cost of shipping your initial inventory from your existing order fulfillment service provider to our warehouse! And if they'll cooperate just a little, we can even make the transition happen with zero downtime. Your customers won't experience a single day of delay.

= Radical Customer Service =

When you work with us, you'll get amazing support. You'll also get the direct phone numbers and emails of our entire management team. You want to chat with the CEO? Call him in the middle of the night on his cell phone. Our team is here for you. (Okay, try not to call him in the middle of the night. Unless you really wanna.)


== Installation ==

1. You will need an account with us to interface to our shipping system. [Contact us](http://www.miraclefulfillment.com/contact.php "Contact Miracle Fulfillment") to discuss your needs and to receive a quote. Our phone number is 505-340-3586.
2. When we create your account, we'll email you a customer code that will be needed when you configure the plugin.
3. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
5. Go to WooCommerce->Settings and click on the "Integration" tab to configure the plugin.
6. Copy the customer code from the email we will sent you in #2 above, and paste it into the field on this screen.
7. The Admin email will default to the email specified in the General Settings of your WordPress site. If you prefer to use a different email, you may enter it here.
8. Leave the other settings as they are unless we've discussed any special reasons for changing them. 
9. Click "Save Changes".

That's it! From this point forward your incoming orders will be automatically imported into our warehouse shipping systems and tracking information will be added to your orders after we ship them!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How quickly will my orders ship? =

When a customer orders your product, they expect it to be shipped immediately. Any order for expedited shipping that we receive by 11am will ALWAYS go out the same day. Expedited shipping orders received after that may still go out the same day, but will certainly ship by the next business day. Orders without expedited shipping will still usually ship the same day, but will never wait more than two business days.

= Where does Miracle Fulfillment ship? =

We offer full service shipping around the world. No matter where your customers are, if they can receive mail then we can ship to them.

= How much does order fulfillment and warehousing cost with Miracle Fulfillment? =

It all depends upon your specific needs and the kinds of packages you'll ship with us. In order to determine pricing we need information about package sizes, assembly requirements, padding needs, storage space needed, order volume, special handling needs, and more. 

What we can say though, is that we promise to work with you to get the pricing as low as we possibly can. We strive to price everything with flat rates rather than hourly rates because we never want there to be a perceived conflict of interest where working slowly lets us charge you more. We'll tell you upfront exactly what everything will cost, and we'll stick to it.
